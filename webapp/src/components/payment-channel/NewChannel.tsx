        This feature is a valuable addition to StreamPayâ„¢, as it enables users to establish payment channels between payers and payees, 
        streamlining the process of making multiple payments through individual claims. 
        It essentially functions as a digital invoicing system, which is commonly used when customers need to make recurring or multiple payouts to service or product providers. 
        This feature not only enhances convenience but also brings efficiency and transparency to financial transactions within the platform.

            A payment channel has been established between the payer and payee, enabling the payee to withdraw money from the channel multiple times. Each withdrawal is secured by a claim containing a signed signature from the payer. <br /><br />This payment channel setup reduces transaction fees for the payer, and the payee is responsible for paying the transaction fees. This method facilitates micro payments on the blockchain, making small transactions more efficient and cost-effective.
